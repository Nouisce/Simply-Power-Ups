**Curios API is a required dependency and I highly recommend the [Colorful Hearts Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/colorful-hearts)**

A Simple Curios API Bauble Powerup Mod

**Information**

This mod is very early in development but I have big plans for it. Power ups do not stack, you will need to upgrade them to a higher tier for a higher effect. Currently there are only 3 power ups and only one tier of power ups. So far all of the power ups are very self explanitory.

**Mob Hearts** ![heart](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/589bb39d7c078e6a5bd7b7a78e7cbff719d6b72d.png)

Mob hearts are required to craft the Health Powerup. Anytime an entity drops experience there is a 10% chance it will drop a mob heart

**Known Issues**

When unequipping a flight power up you will keep the ability to fly until you relog or die
