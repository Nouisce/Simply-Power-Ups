**Information**

This mod is very early in development and will probably never be finished. Power ups do not stack, you will need to upgrade them to a higher tier for a higher effect. Currently there are only 3 power ups. So far all of the power ups are very self explanitory. Higher tier power ups require the use of a smithing table and netherite upgrade template. Please use jei to see recipies.

**Mob Hearts** ![heart](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/589bb39d7c078e6a5bd7b7a78e7cbff719d6b72d.png)

Mob hearts are required to craft the Health Powerup. Anytime an entity drops experience there is a 10% chance it will drop a mob heart

**Warden Heart** ![warden heart](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/41f9fba1ee8c1588ed2868beece8b220420e9744.png)

Dropped when the warden is killed. Used for crafting high tier power ups.

**Dragon Claw** ![dragon claw](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/65024993f498bee0e554208d99b5665917826bef.png)

Dropped when the dragon is killed. Used for crafting high tier power ups.

**Speed Gems**![speed gem 2](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/3f0ed3f2fdb7ce5399db61d0c38218190c829bfe.png)

Speed gems are craftable items used to make speed power ups.

**Planned**

- Custom crafting table
- Fabric port
- New power ups
- ~~Forge port~~


**Known Issues**

- When unequipping a flight power up you will keep the ability to fly until you relog or die
(Fixed in 0.5.6 for neoforge havent figured out a way to fix it in forge)
